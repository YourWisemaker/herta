    config: `
${chalk.bold('Configuration in Herta.js')}

Herta.js configurations allow you to customize the framework's behavior according to your specific needs. Configuration is handled through a 'herta.config.js' file in your project root.

${chalk.yellow('Key Configuration Options:')}

${chalk.bold('precision:')} Controls the decimal precision used in calculations.
  Example: { precision: 10 } will use 10 decimal places for calculations.

${chalk.bold('threads:')} Controls parallel processing behavior.
  Example: { threads: 4 } will use 4 worker threads for applicable operations.

${chalk.bold('memoize:')} Enables caching of function results for repeated calculations.
  Example: { memoize: true } will cache results of expensive operations.

${chalk.bold('Scientific Mode:')} Enables higher precision and additional validation.
  Example: { scientificMode: true }

${chalk.dim(`
// herta.config.js
module.exports = {

${chalk.yellow('Folder Structure:')}

${chalk.dim(`
herta/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Core mathematical functionality
│   ├── advanced/       # Advanced domain-specific modules
│   └── utils/          # Utility functions
└── test/               # Test suite
`)}
`,

    patterns: `
${chalk.bold('Design Patterns in Herta.js')}

Herta.js uses several design patterns to organize code and solve common problems:

${chalk.yellow('Factory Pattern:')}

Used to create complex objects with consistent interfaces. For example, creating matrix objects, neural networks, or probability distributions.

${chalk.dim(`
// Example: Factory pattern for creating matrices
const matrix = herta.matrix.create(rows, cols);
const identity = herta.matrix.identity(size);
`)}

${chalk.yellow('Strategy Pattern:')}

Used to select algorithms at runtime. For example, choosing different optimization strategies or solvers.

${chalk.dim(`
// Example: Strategy pattern for optimization
const optimizer = herta.optimization.createOptimizer('gradient-descent', options);
optimizer.minimize(costFunction);
`)}

${chalk.yellow('Observer Pattern:')}

Used for event handling and progress tracking in long-running operations.

${chalk.dim(`
// Example: Observer pattern for training progress
const model = herta.neuralNetworks.feedForward([10, 5, 1]);
model.onEpoch(progress => console.log(\`Epoch \${progress.epoch}: \${progress.error}\`));
model.train(data, { epochs: 1000 });
`)}

${chalk.yellow('Decorator Pattern:')}

Used to add capabilities to functions without modifying their core behavior. For example, adding memoization or logging.

${chalk.dim(`
// Example: Decorator pattern for memoization
const memoized = herta.utils.memoize(expensiveFunction);
`)}

These patterns help maintain clean, maintainable code while providing powerful abstractions.
`,

  - Sparse matrices for data with many zeros.
  - Stream processing for large datasets that don't fit in memory.

${chalk.yellow('Technical Optimizations:')}

  - Matrix operations can run on multiple threads.
  - Optional GPU acceleration for specific operations.

${chalk.bold('Early Termination:')} Stopping algorithms when sufficient precision is reached.
  - Iterative methods terminate when convergence criteria are met.
  - Adaptive precision adjusts based on input requirements.

${chalk.yellow('Performance Tips:')}

1. Enable memoization for repeated calculations with the same inputs.
2. Use appropriate data structures (e.g., sparse matrices for sparse data).
3. Set thread count based on your CPU core count.
4. Consider using lower precision for exploratory work and higher precision for final results.
5. Profile your code to identify bottlenecks.

You can monitor performance with the built-in benchmarking tools:
${chalk.dim(`
const benchmark = herta.utils.benchmark();
benchmark.start();
// Your code here
benchmark.end();
console.log(benchmark.report());
`)}
`
  };

  if (explanations[topic]) {
    return explanations[topic];
  }
  const availableTopics = Object.keys(explanations).join(', ');
  throw new Error(`Unknown topic: ${topic}. Available topics: ${availableTopics}, or use 'module:<name>' for module explanations.`);
}
